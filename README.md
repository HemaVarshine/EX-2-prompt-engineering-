# EX-2-prompt-engineering-Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test scenerios

Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. 
     Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.
Prompting Techniques
# Naïve Prompting: 
This involves providing ChatGPT with a simple, direct prompt without any additional context or instructions.
Example: "Describe a sunset."
# Basic Prompting:
This technique involves providing ChatGPT with a more structured prompt, including specific instructions, questions, or examples to guide the response.
Example: "Describe a sunset over the ocean, highlighting the colors in the sky and the reflection on the water, using a poetic tone."

1.Zero-Shot Prompt
Prompt: "Explain what renewable energy is."
Response: Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that replenish themselves over time, such as sunlight, wind, and water. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources do not deplete and produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions, making them more sustainable. Examples include solar panels harnessing sunlight, wind turbines generating electricity, and hydroelectric dams using water flow to produce power.

2.One-Shot Prompt
Prompt: "Explain what renewable energy is. Think of it as energy that comes from sources that naturally replenish over time, like the sun, wind, or water. It’s an alternative to fossil fuels and helps reduce environmental impact. Can you elaborate on this concept in more detail?"
Response: Renewable energy refers to energy obtained from naturally replenishing sources such as sunlight, wind, water, geothermal heat, and biomass. These energy sources are sustainable because they do not run out over human lifetimes. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, wind turbines generate power from the movement of air, and hydropower stations harness the energy of flowing water. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources significantly reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change.

# 1.Design Test Scenarios
Create a diverse set of test scenarios that cover a range of tasks and topics:
Question answering: "Who discovered penicillin?"
Creative writing: "Write a short story about a time traveler who gets stuck in the 1800s."
Summarization: "Summarize the main arguments in the article 'The Impact of Climate Change on Global Agriculture.'"
Translation: "Translate the sentence 'Good morning, have a great day!' into French."
Code generation: "Write a Java function to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers."
Problem-solving: "How can someone improve their memory retention for studying?"
Open-ended questions: "What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of artificial intelligence in education?"
Contextual understanding: "Given the following financial data, predict the company's profitability for next quarter."

# 2.Conduct Experiments
For each test scenario, generate a set of prompts using both naïve and basic prompting techniques. Interact with ChatGPT using each prompt and record the responses. Evaluate the quality and relevance of the responses based on the following criteria:
Accuracy: Does the response provide correct information?
Coherence: Is the response well-structured and easy to understand?
Relevance: Does the response address the prompt effectively?
Creativity: Is the response original and imaginative?
Informativeness: Does the response provide valuable insights or information?
Bias: Is the response free from bias or prejudice?
Factuality: Does the response contain factual errors or inaccuracies?

# 3.Analyze Results
Compare the responses generated using naïve prompting and basic prompting for each test scenario. Identify patterns and trends in the effectiveness of each technique. Analyze the factors that contribute to the differences in response quality, such as prompt specificity, clarity, and relevance. Consider the impact of prompt engineering on ChatGPT’s ability to generate creative, informative, and accurate responses. Evaluate the ethical implications of using ChatGPT for various tasks, such as the potential for generating harmful or misleading content.
Refine Prompts and Experiment Further
Based on the initial analysis, refine the prompting techniques used and conduct additional experiments to explore different approaches. Consider using more complex prompting techniques, such as role-playing or providing examples of desired outputs. Experiment with different ChatGPT models or parameters to see how they affect the quality of responses.

# Overall:
Basic prompting generally outperforms naïve prompting in terms of accuracy, coherence, relevance, and informativeness. However, the effectiveness of each technique may vary depending on the specific task and the complexity of the prompt.

1.Zero-Shot Prompt
Prompt: "Explain quantum computing."
Response: Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or "qubits" that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This property allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of information in parallel, potentially solving certain complex problems much faster than classical computers. Applications include cryptography, drug discovery, materials science, and optimization problems that are currently intractable for conventional computers.

2.One-Shot Prompt
Prompt: "Explain quantum computing. For example, think of it as a new type of computer that uses the principles of quantum physics to solve problems that would take traditional computers thousands of years. Can you elaborate on this concept?"
Response: Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways impossible for classical computers. At its core, quantum computing relies on qubits, which unlike classical bits, can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a phenomenon called superposition. This allows quantum computers to explore multiple solution paths at once.

# Design Test Scenarios
Create a diverse set of test scenarios that cover a range of tasks and topics:
1.Question answering: "What factors contribute to climate change?"
2.Creative writing: "Write a dialogue between an AI and a philosopher discussing the nature of consciousness."
3.Summarization: "Summarize the key findings from the latest IPCC report on climate change."
4.Translation: "Translate the phrase 'The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams' into French."
5.Code generation: "Write a JavaScript function that checks if a string is a palindrome."
6.Problem-solving: "How can a company reduce its carbon footprint while maintaining profitability?"
7.Open-ended questions: "What might be the societal impacts of widespread automation in the workforce?"
8.Contextual understanding: "Given the current trends in renewable energy adoption, what challenges might emerge in the next decade?"

New Example: Chain-of-Thought Prompting with Claude
Prompt: "I need to divide 15 students into 3 equal groups for a project. Then I need to assign each group one of these topics: renewable energy, water conservation, and waste management. Finally, I need to allocate $450 of budget equally among the groups. Walk through this step by step."
Response: I'll solve this problem step by step:
Step 1: Divide 15 students into 3 equal groups.
15 students ÷ 3 groups = 5 students per group
So we'll have Group A, Group B, and Group C, each with 5 students.
Step 2: Assign each group one of the three topics.
Group A: Renewable Energy
Group B: Water Conservation
Group C: Waste Management
Step 3: Allocate the $450 budget equally among the groups.
$450 ÷ 3 groups = $150 per group
Each group will receive $150 for their project.
Step 4: Verify the solution.
All students are assigned: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 students ✓
All topics are assigned: Renewable Energy, Water Conservation, Waste Management ✓
All budget is allocated: $150 + $150 + $150 = $450 ✓
The final arrangement is:
Group A: 5 students, Renewable Energy topic, $150 budget
Group B: 5 students, Water Conservation topic, $150 budget
Group C: 5 students, Waste Management topic, $150 budget
